# LFS Build System - Construction of the Final Phase

This GitHub repository guides you through the construction of the final missing parts of the temporary system as part of the **Linux From Scratch (LFS)** project. These parts include the tools required by the machinery to build multiple packages.

## Objective

The main goal of this chapter is to detail the process of building the final parts of the temporary system, with a focus on using an isolated chroot environment. This environment is entirely separate from the host operating system, except for the kernel.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that all circular dependencies have been resolved. To ensure a functional isolated environment, it is crucial to establish communication channels with the kernel. This is done by mounting virtual kernel filesystems. You can check this using the `findmnt` command.

## Instructions

### 1. Entering the Chroot Environment

Up to Chapter 7.4, all commands must be executed as root, with the LFS environment variable correctly initialized. After entering the chroot environment, all commands are run as root, with no access to the host OS of the computer on which you are building LFS.

### 2. Security

Be cautious when using commands within the chroot environment, as poorly formed commands can potentially damage the entire LFS system. Make sure to carefully follow the instructions provided in the guide to avoid any data loss.
