# System Construction - Reconstruction Branch

This branch is dedicated to the reconstruction of a specific part of the system. This section is divided into three crucial steps for building a new system.<br/>
Make sure to carefully follow the instructions provided in the associated book.

## Objective

The main objective of this branch is to reconstruct a vital part of the system through a three-step process:

1. **Cross-Compiler Construction:** This step involves building a cross-compiler and its associated libraries.

2. **Isolated Tool Construction:** Use the previously built cross-toolchain to create several tools while isolating them from the host distribution.

## Usage

1. **Set the 'lfs' User Environment:** Before starting, ensure that the user environment is correctly set to 'lfs'.

2. **Download and Install Packages:** Follow the book's instructions to download and install the necessary packages.
